     *
     * If the asset is a file, its file modification time will be checked to avoid unnecessary file copying.
     *
     * If the asset is a directory, all files and subdirectories under it will be published recursively. Note, in case
     * $forceCopy is false the method only checks the existence of the target directory to avoid repetitive copying
     * (which is very expensive).

     * published.

     * non-critical problem in the creation of the directory that holds the published assets. This problem can be
     * avoided altogether by 'requesting' in advance all the resources that are supposed to trigger a 'publish()' call,
     * and doing that in the application deployment phase, before system goes live. See more in the following
